        <h1>The Earth: The Ultimate "Open World" for Life</h1>
        <h>Earth, the blue gem of the cosmos, is the only known "life server" in the universe. Equipped with a unique "water cycle system" and a protective "atmospheric shield," Earth allows players to breathe, grow, and even build civilizations! 🌍 Its day-night cycle is powered by a rotational engine, refreshing every 24 hours to deliver alternating sunlight and moonlight. Explore Earth’s four terrain modules—mountains, plains, oceans, and deserts—and unlock hidden NPCs ranging from microscopic bacteria to giant whales. But beware: Earth has an environmental durability bar, and overusing resources could trigger disaster events! Choose Earth for infinite possibilities and a rich gaming experience!</h>
