        <h1>The Moon: Earth's Loyal "Support Planet"</h1>
        <h>The Moon is Earthâ€™s ultimate sidekick, orbiting in a perfectly synced path and completing its "round trip mission" every 27.3 days. Its terrain features crater-filled landscapes, making it a classic challenge map in the universe! The Moon's signature skill is "Tide Control," which refreshes Earthâ€™s ocean dynamics daily. ðŸŒ• Plus, it manages nighttime lighting effects, offering full moon buffs, lunar eclipse events, and starlit skies free from light pollution. Low gravity adds a unique gameplay mechanic, letting players jump higher and move slowerâ€”but with no atmosphere or water resources, survival time is limited. Bring your gear, and dive into the Moonâ€™s serene yet challenging gameplay!</h>
